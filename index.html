                    "This is my daily work . . . When I accomplish something, I write a * line 
                    that day. Whenever a bug / missing feature is mentioned during the day 
                    and I donâ€™t fix it, I make a note of it. Some things get noted many times 
                    before they get fixed. Occasionally I go back through the old notes and 
                    mark with a + the things I have since fixed."
